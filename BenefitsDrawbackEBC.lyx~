\begin_layout Chapter
Benefits and Drawbacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many benefits to using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, some
 apply now other may come to be if and when cryptocurrencies become more
 adopted in more conventional places.
 Some key benefits include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a self-regulating system, no unexpected interventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
no need for middlemen, such as banks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
virtually instant transactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are also a number of important drawbacks, such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extreme relience on the Bitcoin protocol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Severe consequences of being hacked
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased Relience on the Internet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
A Self-Regulating System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bitcoin system is self-regulating, meaning that no government or institution
 controls it.
 For the user that means that their holdings cannot be used as a policy
 instrument.
 Conventional fiat currencies are owned by a government, which means that
 they can be used to e.g.
 stimulate economic growth by printing extra money, which lessens the value
 of individuals holdings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
No middlemen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, users control their own holdings on their own computer, which
 eliminates the need for a bank.
 This brings the advantage that users are not dependent on open hours, waiting
 lines, or e-banking websites, it also means no fees.
 Additionally a user's holdings cannot be wiped out by his or her bank bankrupti
ng after speculative investing or something of that sort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Virtually Instant Transactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thirdly, transactions are as easy, instant, and costless as sending an email.
 Bitcoin exists online digitally, which means that there is no physical
 counterpart that needs to be moved, such as with gold, or paper money.
 Additionally, it is equally valid across countries, which means that there
 is no need to exchange it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Full Relience on the Protocol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is an erro in an online banking system this has the potential to
 create enormous problems.
 However, in situations like these, the banking system can always fall back
 on the underlying legal system.
 For Bitcoin there is no such fallback mechanism, if a critical error were
 to be found in the system, it would render not only have the potentional
 for things to go wrong, it would eliminate the trust in the system, yet
 more then any other system, Bitcoin relies on this trust.
 Therefore a single error could wipe out the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Severe Consequences of Being Hacked
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In anyonline sphere hacking has always been a problem, often it is made
 lucrative by stealing creditcard details or other personal information.
 However, when savings are stored in Bitcoin, the potential damage of being
 hacked is much greater than having your creditcard charged with something
 you did not buy, it could wipe out all of your savings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Increased Relience on the Internet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using Bitcoin as a payment mechanism is very effective since everything
 is conducted online, however, it also means that without availability of
 internet, everything comes to a halt.
