\chapter{Is Bitcoin Legal?}

The short answer is yet, of course this does not mean that anything
that you use Bitcoin for is legal. That is to say, it is still illegal
to purchase elicit goods, or hide holdings from the tax bureau.

The legal standing of Bitcoin is different in many countries. 


\section*{Currency or Financial Asset?}

In many places Bitcoin has been classified as a financial asset for
purposes of taxation. This means that it is not recognised as a currency
again for purposes of taxation. It several court rulings however,
it has been found that Bitcoin does act as a currency. In both cases
the legality of Bitcoin is underlines, however, the distinction can
be relevant in some cases. For instance, in case of a bankrupcy (such
as the 2014 Mt. Gox case) financial assets and currencies are treated
quite differently.
