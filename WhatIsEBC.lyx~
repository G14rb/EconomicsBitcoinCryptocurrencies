What is Bitcoin?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A short answer is that it is an online anonymous currency which is not controlle
d by any single government or entity.
 However, from a technical perspective there are many innovative features
 to Bitcoin, and I will begin by highlighting the key ones.

is a confusing term.
 It is both a monetary unit of denomination, such as Swiss franc, euro,
 or pound sterling, as well as, a monetary system as a whole, including
 the protocol, the network, and all participants.
 To distinguish between the two, the system

 is written with a capital letter B, and the monetary unit of account is

, is written with a small letter b.
 Furthermore, there is the original Bitcoin software, which is called

, using this software package, or others, computer can connect to the Bitcoin
 network.

is built from the ground up to be decentralised and anonymous.
 All software is open source and publicly available.
 Anybody can perform any function within the network (user or node), there
 is no central or essential node, there is redundancy in every aspect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The essential principle is that every user has a piece of software on their
 computer, a

, which contains a set of public addresses (like bank account numbers),
 each address is mathematically linked with a 
\series bold

\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

 (like a password).
 Using this secret key, users can create a digital 
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

\end_inset

, to prove that they are the owner of an address.
 This signature, together with a transaction is sent to a bitcoin

.
 The miner is a node in the network, which verifies that the address and
 signature are linked, after which the transaction is recorded in the public
 ledger, or

 and disseminated throughout the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of other features which are important to highlight.
 Bitcoins are created through a process called mining, this is a computationally
 intensive process used as the mechanism for transaction verification.
 The Bitcoins created as a reward for mining becomes incrementally smaller,
 until finally becoming zero.
 This is predicted to be around the year 2140, and at that point around
 21 million bitcoins will have been created.
 There will never be more bitcoins in the system.
 Furthermore, bitcoins will be lost if private keys are lost, these will
 never be recovered.
 The system is thus strictly deflationary.
 To keep transactions of every size possible, bitcoins are highly granular,
 every bitcoin can be divided into a hundred million
