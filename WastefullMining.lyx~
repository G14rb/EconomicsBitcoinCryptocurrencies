\begin_layout Chapter
Is mining socially wasteful?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value of the mining process is an often raised issue.
 As described above, the process of mining is the solving of computational
 problems, in order to secure the integrity of the Bitcoin network.
 However, the actual social value of the arithmetic solution itself is zero,
 since it has no application other than Bitcoin integrity.
 As the number of bitcoins is limited, and more money is invested in it,
 the value can only increase.
 The increase in value will make it more lucrative to engage in bitcoin
 mining, which means more computational power will be devoted to this.
 To keep the system secure in face of this extra computing power, the difficulty
 of verification automatically goes up.
 However, had the extra power not come in, this would not have been necessary.
 The extra computers which engage in bitcoin mining thus do not add any
 social value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has to be noted, that the bar for social value is being set very high.
 Extraction, storage, and transfer of value is a resource intensive enterprise.
 Consider the gold mining industry (note, this is the origin of the term
 bitcoin mining).
 The extraction of gold is a very resource intensive, dangerous, and pollutive
 process.
 After the extraction, purification, and moulding, most gold is stored highly
 guarded in vaults.
 Finally then, gold can be utilised to conduct transactions, which involves
 shipping bars of gold across the ocean under maximum security, only to
 be stored in another highly protected vault, upon arrival

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system of fiat currencies is already much more efficient than this.
 There is no difficult extraction and purification process.
 Bank notes are printed by governments and provides with authenticity checks.
 Bank strike out debts against each other and only every so often is printed
 money actually transfered from one bank to the other.
 However, this is again a highly secured process of physically moving objects
 (in this case banknotes) from one location to the other.
 Often followed by a reverse transfer several days later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution for both these lies in the multiplicity of cryptocurrencies.
 As mentioned above, every aspect of Bitcoin is open and publicly accessible,
 it is therefore relatively easy to start an alternative Bitcoin, and this
 has been done.
 There are in fact many currencies based on the Bitcoin protocol, collectively
 referred to as cryptocurrencies.
 It is relatively easy and cheap to construct a cryptocurrency, whereby
 the number of available coins can be set by the creator.
 The most popular alternative to Bitcoin is called Litecoin, its main difference
 is that it processes transactions faster, and the total number of coins
 is four times as high.
 Aside Litecoin, there are many other alternative cryptocurrencies, most
 of which never gain momentum and the value of which remains only trivially
 above zero.
 However, a significant number does succeed.
 Unlike the creation of new coins in an existing cryptocurrency, the creation
 of new cryptocurrencies is relatively cheap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key point to observe here, is that cryptocurrencies do have value, but
 only as a transaction mechanism.
 Hereby the biggest bottleneck is probably the number of cryptocurrencies
 that retailers are willing the accept simultaneously.
 However, due to their similarity, it is very straightforward for e.g.
 retailers to accept multiple currencies.
 When we combine the value with the relatively costless creation of cryptocurren
cies, we see an equilibrium in the number of cryptocurrencies that is far
 higher than in the current situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted earlier, cryptocurrencies have value, because they are effective
 mechanisms for transactions.
 However, this is the only source from which their value derives.
 If a cryptocurrency becomes too expensive (which causes excessive mining),
 a new, lower valued, cryptocurrency will arise.
 Since the value of this currency is lower, but it is equally effective
 in transactions, value will flow out of the overvalued cryptocurrency and
 into the undervalued one.
 This lowers the value of the overvalued cryptocurrency, and less mining
 will be done here, reducing the waste.
