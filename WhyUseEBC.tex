This makes Bitcoin an ideal mechanism for remittances, which nowadays
can cost as much as 10 percent. Additionally no government can apply
capital restrictions on these remittances. Lastly, the instant nature
of transactions means it is well suited for online retailing. Credit

percentage is in fact reversed after initial clearance. This is very
costly for retailers, this often occurs after packaging of shipping
has started.
