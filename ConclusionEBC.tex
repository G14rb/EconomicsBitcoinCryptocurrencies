\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have an enormous potential
as a transaction mechanism, giving users control of their own holdings
and making transactions instant and costs negligible. Two commonly
heard issues with cryptocurrencies are deflation and wasteful mining.
It can be shown that these issues are not pervasive, when the cryptocurrency
economy as a whole is considered. Cryptocurrencies derive their value
only from being an efficient transaction mechanism, if they appear
to become overvalued (causing excessive mining), other cryptocurrencies
will arise. This will increase the total number of cryptocoins (between
all cryptocurrencies), which will drive down the price, and limit
excessive mining.
