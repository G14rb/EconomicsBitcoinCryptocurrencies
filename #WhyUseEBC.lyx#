\begin_layout Chapter
Why use Bitcoin?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many benefits to using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, some
 apply now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, the system is self-regulating, meaning that no government or institutio
n controls it.
 For the user that means that their holdings cannot be used as a policy
 instrument.
 Conventional fiat currencies are owned by a government, which means that
 they can be used to e.g.
 stimulate economic growth by printing extra money, which lessens the value
 of individuals holdings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, users control their own holdings on their own computer, which
 eliminates the need for a bank.
 This brings the advantage that users are not dependent on open hours, waiting
 lines, or e-banking websites, it also means no fees.
 Additionally a user's holdings cannot be wiped out by his or her bank bankrupti
ng after speculative investing or something of that sort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thirdly, transactions are as easy, instant, and costless as sending an email.
 Bitcoin exists online digitally, which means that there is no physical
 counterpart that needs to be moved, such as with gold, or paper money.
 Additionally, it is equally valid across countries, which means that there
 is no need to exchange it.
 This makes Bitcoin an ideal mechanism for remittances, which nowadays can
 cost as much as 10 percent.
 Additionally no government can apply capital restrictions on these remittances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, the instant nature of transactions means it is well suited for online
 retailing.
 Credit card transactions seem instant, but in fact are not.
 A significant percentage is in fact reversed after initial clearance.
 This is very costly for retailers, this often occurs after packaging of
 shipping has started.
