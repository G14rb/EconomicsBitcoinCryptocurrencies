Cryptocurrency competition: Hayek's Paradise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bitcoin first become popular in several underground movements.
 As such it has been hauled as a major innovation in a self-identified movement

.
 The main idea behind crypto-anarchism is that cryptography empowers individuals
 to protect themselves from harmfull government medelling.
 It is not suprising that many of the economic principles on which

 is economic academia, such as the Austrian School and Monetary Economics.

If we consider the cryptocurrency space as a whole we seem to approach the
 'Decentralization of Money' as descibed by

Friedrich Hayek (1976)
\color inherit
.
 Hayek describes a situation in which currencies are no longer owned by
 governments, but in stead are owned by private companies.
 In this transnational currency space, the most currency or currencies most
 favorable to consumers would be adopted strongest and would become dominant.
 The situation of there being several competing cryptocurrencies in comes
 very close to the system as invisioned by Hayek.
 It also addresses some of the key critisisms of this vision, as raised
 for example by Milton Friedman...

PERHAPS A DISCUSSION OF GRESHAMS LAW IN THIS CRYPTOCURRENCY COMPETITION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although Hayek firmly believed in the self-regulating currency market, the
 market itself was made up of self-serving firms which owned and controlled
 the currencies.
 Cryptocurrencies go a step further, in making the currencies self-regulating
 and making only the individuals currency holders self-serving actors.

Faith in Markets

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear from the discussion of Hayek's view that denationalization of
 money relies on a highly effective market order.
 This seems problematic in several ways.
 Firstly, as history has shown, the fact that banks (which would be the
 issuers of currencies

\begin_layout Standard
In recent years, there have been many economic insights into how, under
 a situation of information asymetry, market efficiency does not hold (STIGLITZ).
 In a sitution where several dominant currencies have a lot of market power,
 it would not be hard to conceive of a situation where these companies could
 utilize their information advantage to extract rents from the public.
 We can now see how a cryptocurrency would fit this idea even more than
 a privately owned currency.
 All information about the currency is always recorded in the public ledger,
 and directly accessible on the internet.
